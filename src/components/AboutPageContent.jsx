              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                Our mission is to make stamp collecting accessible and enjoyable for all enthusiasts. We aim to preserve the rich history and artistry of stamps, focusing on not only rare and iconic collections but also lesser-known pieces that tell the stories of different cultures, events, and milestones throughout history.
              </p>
              <p>
                By sharing these stamps and their histories, we hope to ignite a passion for philately and promote the importance of stamp collecting as both a hobby and a historical pursuit. Our platform seeks to provide information, context, and education on stamps from around the world, including rare and unique collections that deserve recognition.

              <h2>Sri Lankan Stamps Collection</h2>
              <p>
                The Sri Lankan stamps collection is one of the most vibrant and culturally rich collections we feature. Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, has been issuing stamps since 1857, making its collection one of the oldest in Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, Sri Lankan stamps have depicted a wide range of themes, including the nation's historical events, natural beauty, wildlife, cultural heritage, and prominent figures. The collection includes everything from early colonial issues to modern commemorative stamps that honor Sri Lanka’s progress and international relations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some notable series include stamps commemorating the country’s independence, the heritage of ancient Sri Lankan architecture, and special issues for international events such as the Colombo Plan and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).
              </p>
              <p>
                Collecting Sri Lankan stamps provides insight into the country’s rich history and artistic legacy, offering collectors an opportunity to explore everything from traditional craftsmanship to modern design trends.
